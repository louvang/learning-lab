# cars

A simple React app that allows a user to add a car and its cost. The app will display the list of cars and calculate the total. Additionally, it will highlight any cases if the input of a new car matches a car that already is in the list. There is also a search option that filters through the list of cars.

The app focuses primarily on using the Redux Toolkit to produce multiple reducers.

Created from Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux online course.
