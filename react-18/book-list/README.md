# book-list

Very simple app that simulates a book list with randomly generated images from an free image API. This app also uses the `json-server` package to create an API server that persists book storage data (for development purposes).

This app is made from a tutorial in Stephen Grider's 'Modern React with Redux' online course. This particular tutorial emphasized the `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useContext` hooks.
