# image-search

A simple React app that pulls images from the <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash API</a> and displays them upon search.

This app will require creating a .env file in the root directory with the following key:

```
UNSPLASH_KEY="<your Unsplash access key here>"
```

Made from a tutorial in Stephen Grider's 'Modern React with Redux' online course.
