A TypeScript framework.

To run this application, you will need to also run parcel and json-server. Make sure you are in the `/web` directory if you have cloned the entire repo.

1. Open a Terminal and run `npm run start:parcel`. The application should now be serving locally at http://localhost:1234
2. Open a second Terminal and run `npm run start:db`. The database should now be serving locally at http://localhost:3000
